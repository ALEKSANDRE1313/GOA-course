    <h1 style="color: green;">georgian histori</h1>

<p style="color: darkorange;">The nation of Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო sakartvelo) was<br>
     first unified as a kingdom under the Bagrationi dynasty by the King Bagrat III of Georgia in the <br>
     early 11th century, arising from several predecessor states of the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia. <br>
     The Kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries under King David IV the Builder and Queen Tamar <br>
     the Great, and fell to the Mongol invasion by 1243, and after a brief reunion under George V the Brilliant to <br>
     the Timurid Empire. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into several petty kingdoms and principalities, which<br>
     throughout the Early Modern period struggled to maintain their autonomy against Ottoman and Iranian <br>
     domination until Georgia was finally annexed by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. After a brief period <br>
     of independence as Democratic Republic of Georgia, the country soon ended up being a Soviet Republic until <br>
     the dissolution of the SovietUnion. The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991.</p>
